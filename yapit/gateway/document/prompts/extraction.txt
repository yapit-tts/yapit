<goal>
Extract the document page as clean markdown.

Your output serves two purposes: visual display and text-to-speech (TTS) audio.
The visual appearance must be faithful to the source.
The audio should sound natural.

Most content needs no special handling — just accurate markdown.
Special tags exist for cases where visual display and audio should differ to enhance listening experience.
</goal>


<contex>
- Follow standard markdown: headings (#, ##), lists, *emphasis*, **strong emphasis**, tables, etc.
- Footnotes and callouts are currently not supported.

Elements that are both shown and spoken:
- Paragraphs
- Headings 
- Linktext
- List items
- Text within Quote blocks

Elements that are shown but not spoken:
- Tables
- $inline$ and $$display$$ math
- `inline` code and code blocks
- Images - ![alt](detected-image)
- Markdown elements within <yap-show> tags

Elements that are not shown but spoken:
- Text within <yap-speak> tags
- Image alt-text (spoken if the image does not have a caption)

Elements that are not shown and not spoken:
- Links without linktext [](url) -> nothing (worthless) 

Other:
- The <yap-cap> tags is a wrapper for inline markdown content, used to style figures with their captions.
- Emphasis is visual, the emphasized text is spoken normally.

<formatting_guide>

- Links
  - Format: [descriptive text](url)
  - Link test is read oud, make it sound natural, e.g.:
    - "https://github.com/..." → [GitHub](url)
    - "https://arxiv.org/..." → [arXiv](url)
    - "Project website with videos: https://..." -> "[Project website](https://...) with videos"
  - Raw urls ("https://...") without link text are read literally - this is ususally undesirable

- Tables
  - Standard markdown table syntax, inline math, code, emphasis, all allowed
  - Do not use <yap-show> or <yap-speak> inside tables, since tables are already entirely visual-only

- Noise to skip
  - Page numbers
  - Headers/footers
  - Watermarks

- Math / KaTeX compatibility
  - If an equation has a number in the original (e.g., "(1)" next to it), include inside LaTeX: $$E=mc^2 \tag{1}$$
  - Use \begin{align} not \begin{aligned} when equations have \tag{}
  - A blank line is required BEFORE each $$block$$.
  - $$block$$ must be standalone, i.e. no other content (be it text, yap tags) on the same line
  - Prefer to group equations that appear together in the source into a single $$...$$ block with \begin{align} ... \end{align} rather than multiple separate $$...$$ blocks.

- <yap-show> 
  - Wraps inline content
  - Must be single-line - no newlines inside tag content
  - Use for inline visual elements that should not be spoken
  - Do not use this for or within elements that are already not spoken (such as images, math, code blocks, tables)

- <yap-speak>
  - Wraps raw text that is passed to TTS
  - Must be single-line - no newlines inside tag content
  - Content must not contain any markdown formatting
  - Content can include punctuation (mainly periods, commas) to guide TTS prosody
  - Combine with math or yap-show to enhance the listening experience

- <yap-cap>
  - Wrapps inline content (including yap-show, yap-speak) that is displayed as figure caption
  - Must be single-line - no newlines inside tag content
  - Accompanies an image placeholder: ![alt](detected-image)<yap-cap>caption</yap-cap>

- Images
  - Format: ![alt](detected-image)<yap-cap>caption</yap-cap>
    - alt = short visual description of what the image shows
    - <yap-cap>...</yap-cap> = figure caption from the document (omit if no caption)
    - IMPORTANT: <yap-cap> must be on the SAME LINE as the image, no newline between
  - You will be provided with the number of detected images on the page.
  - If no image count is provided, do not output any image placeholders.
  - For each detected image, output exactly one image placeholder at the position where it appears in source.
  - All images share the same "detected-image" placeholder.

- Reference sections
  - If page has "References" header: output "## References\n\n[references omitted]"
  - If page is just continuation of references: output only "[references omitted]"

- Citations
  - Wrap citations that do not fit naturally into running text with <yap-show>
    - "..., long short-term memory [13] and ..." → "..., long short-term memory <yap-show>[13]</yap-show> and ..."
    - "The Abstraction and Reasoning Corpus (ARC; Figure 1) (Chollet, 2019) offers ..." → "The Abstraction and Reasoning Corpus <yap-show>(ARC; Figure 1) (Chollet, 2019)</yap-show> offers ..."
  - Author citations in running text: naturalize for speech
    - "Concurrently to this work, Smith et al. (2020) ..." → "Concurrently to this work, Smith and colleagues ..."
    - "As [1] showed" → "As prior work showed"

<speech_for_math>

As math is never read aloud, speech tags are sometimes needed to avoid awkward gaps in narration and enhance the listening experience.

- Add speech when:
  - The math is a natural part of the sentence structure/text, e.g., introduces a symbol, variable, or value
  - Omitting would leave an awkward gap or lose information

- When to skip speech:
  - Visual markers ($^1$, $^\dagger$)
  - Complex equations that can't be meaningfully verbalized - derivations, proofs, multi-line formulas where a reader would pause to study visually rather than listen
  - Cases where it would lead to stutters or repetition
    - "The greek letter $\alpha$ alpha ..." - "alpha" is already in the text, so no need to repeat

- How to write speech:
  - Write as a human would read
  - Ignore visual formatting: $\mathbf{z}$ → "z", NOT "bold z", $\mathcal{L}$ → "L" not "script L"
  - Literal for simple math: $Q$ → "Q", $\alpha$ → "alpha", $n=5$ → "n equals 5"
  - Naturalize / reword to improve flow IFF contextually appropriate
    - $$h = \frac{v}{n} \times 360 \quad \text{(Hue calculation)}$$ → "<yap-speak>The hue h is calculated as v over n times 360</yap-speak>"
    - "The state of the system can be represented as the set $S = \{s_1, s_2, \ldots, s_n\}$" → "The state of the system can be represented as the set<yap-speak>S, defined as s one, s two, up to s n</yap-speak>"
    - "Given $z$, the decoder then generates an output sequence $(y_1, \ldots, y_m)$" → "Given $z$<yap-speak>z</yap-speak>, the decoder then generates an output sequence<yap-speak>y one, up to y m</yap-speak>"
    - $\mathcal{O}(n^2)$ → "order n squared"
    - $W_i^Q \in \mathbb{R}^{d_{\text{model}} \times d_k}$<yap-speak>W Q of dimensions d model by d k</yap-speak>

<example>
Contrast the following examples:

- Standalone:
  - $$V^\pi(s) = \mathbb{E}_{a \sim \pi}\left\{\sum_{t=0}^\infty \gamma^t r_t\right\}$$ → <yap-speak>the value of state s under policy pi is the expected discounted return when starting in s and taking actions according to pi</yap-speak>
- Embedded in text:
  - "We calculate the value function $V^\pi(s)$ as $V^\pi(s) = \mathbb{E}_{a \sim \pi}\left\{\sum_{t=0}^\infty \gamma^t r_t\right\}$" → "We calculate the value function $V^\pi(s)$<yap-speak>V pi of s</yap-speak> as $V^\pi(s) = \mathbb{E}_{a \sim \pi}\left\{\sum_{t=0}^\infty \gamma^t r_t\right\}$<yap-speak>the expected discounted return when starting in s and taking actions according to pi</yap-speak>"

NOTE how
- Both examples verbalize the same formula with surrounding context (omitted for brevity), but the embedded version breaks it up to fit naturally into the sentence structure.
</example>

<example>
"Assume that the components of $q$<yap-speak>q</yap-speak> and $k$<yap-speak>k</yap-speak> are independent random variables with mean $0$<yap-speak>zero</yap-speak> and variance $1$<yap-speak>one</yap-speak>. Then their dot product, $q \cdot k = \sum_{i=1}^{d_k} q_i k_i$, has mean $0$<yap-speak>zero</yap-speak> and variance $d_k$<yap-speak>d sub k</yap-speak>."

NOTE how
- The dot product formula COULD have been verbalized as <yap-speak>the sum of q i times k i, from i equals one to d k</yap-speak>
- BUT was skipped, since the context already explains what the formula represents, and verbalizing it would be redundant and disrupt the flow
</example>

<example>
"Where the projections are parameter matrices $W_i^Q \in \mathbb{R}^{d_{\text{model}} \times d_k}, W_i^K \in \mathbb{R}^{d_{\text{model}} \times d_k}, W_i^V \in \mathbb{R}^{d_{\text{model}} \times d_v}$<yap-speak>W Q and W K of dimensions d model by d k, and W V of dimensions d model by d v</yap-speak>, and $W^O \in \mathbb{R}^{h d_v \times d_{\text{model}}}$<yap-speak>W O of dimensions h times d v by d model</yap-speak>."

NOTE how
- Math and yap tags are not unnecessarily interleaved.
- The speech is not a literal reading, but naturalizes - in this example - by grouping parts that share context ("of dimensions ...").
</example>

<example>
"""
We compute the matrix of outputs as:

$$\text{Attention}(Q, K, V) = \text{softmax}\left(\frac{QK^T}{\sqrt{d_k}}\right)V \tag{1}$$
<yap-speak>the softmax of Q K transpose over the square root of d k, all times V</yap-speak>
"""

NOTE how:
- Since the formula is introduced in the sentence before AND it is simple enough, it is spoken.
- The formula is slightly reworded to follow the preceding text naturally (omitted "Attention equals"; dropped equation number).
- Were the formula any more complex (in terms of natural verbalization) it would be better to skip the speech entirely, even though it is introduced in text.
