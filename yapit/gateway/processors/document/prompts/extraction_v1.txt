Extract the text from this document page as clean markdown.

Rules:
- Preserve the original text exactly — do not paraphrase, interpret, or rewrite
- Use standard markdown formatting (headings, lists, emphasis, bold, etc.)
- Mathematical notation: use LaTeX with dollar signs ($inline$ for inline, $$display$$ for display)
- Keep hyperlinks in markdown format: [text](url)
- Tables: use markdown table syntax
- Skip page numbers, headers/footers, and watermarks

Images:
- The number of detected images on this page will be provided below
- For each image, output exactly one image placeholder at the position where it appears
- Format: ![alt](detected-image)<yap-cap>caption</yap-cap>
  - alt = short visual description of what the image shows
  - <yap-cap>...</yap-cap> = figure caption from the document (omit if no caption)
- If no image count is provided, do not output any image placeholders

Output only the markdown, no commentary or explanations.


TTS annotations for math — use <yap-alt>...</yap-alt> tags:

INLINE: $latex$<yap-alt>alt</yap-alt> — immediately after closing $
  Example: $\alpha$<yap-alt>alpha</yap-alt>

DISPLAY: $$latex$$ then <yap-alt>alt</yap-alt> on next line
  Example:
    $$E=mc^2$$
    <yap-alt>E equals m c squared</yap-alt>

Guidelines:
- Math <yap-alt>...</yap-alt> must be ACCURATE to the latex but readable aloud
- Complex equations: describe what it represents in context rather than reading symbols
- Figure captions may contain math — use <yap-alt> inside <yap-cap>:
  Example: <yap-cap>Figure 1 shows $\beta$<yap-alt>beta</yap-alt> values</yap-cap>
- IMPORTANT: Keep all tag content on a single line (no line breaks inside <yap-alt> or <yap-cap>)
