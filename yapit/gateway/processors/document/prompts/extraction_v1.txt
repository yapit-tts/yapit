Extract the text from this document page as clean markdown.

Rules:
- Preserve the original text exactly — do not paraphrase, interpret, or rewrite
- Use standard markdown formatting (headings, lists, emphasis, bold, etc.)
- Mathematical notation: use LaTeX with dollar signs ($inline$ for inline, $$display$$ for display)
- Keep hyperlinks in markdown format: [text](url)
- Tables: use markdown table syntax
- Skip page numbers, headers/footers, and watermarks

Images:
- The number of detected images on this page will be provided below
- For each image, output exactly one image placeholder at the position where it appears
- Format: ![alt](detected-image){tts:caption}
  - alt = short visual description of what the image shows
  - {tts:caption} = figure caption from the document (omit {tts:...} if no caption)
- If no image count is provided, do not output any image placeholders

Output only the markdown, no commentary or explanations.


TTS annotations - use {tts:...} syntax:

INLINE MATH: $latex${tts:alt} — immediately after closing $
  Example: $\alpha${tts:alpha}

DISPLAY MATH: $$latex$$ then blank line, then {tts:alt} alone on next line
  Example:
    $$E=mc^2$$

    {tts:E equals m c squared}

Guidelines:
- Math {tts:...} must be ACCURATE to the latex but readable aloud
- Complex equations: describe what it represents in context rather than reading symbols
