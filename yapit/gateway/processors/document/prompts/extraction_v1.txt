Extract the text from this document page as clean markdown.

Rules:
- Preserve the original text exactly — do not paraphrase, interpret, or rewrite
- Use standard markdown formatting (headings, lists, emphasis, bold, etc.)
- Mathematical notation: use LaTeX with dollar signs ($inline$ for inline, $$display$$ for display)
- Keep hyperlinks in markdown format: [text](url)
- Tables: use markdown table syntax
- Skip page numbers, headers/footers, and watermarks

Images:
- The number of detected images on this page will be provided below
- For each image, output exactly one ![](detected-image) placeholder on its own line, at the position where the image appears in the document flow
- Do not describe or caption the images — just place the placeholder
- If no image count is provided, do not output any image placeholders

Output only the markdown, no commentary or explanations.
