- How can we calculate (do we need to approximate) the lenght of generated audio? (e.g. for large texts/docs)
- How will we make the progressbar be able to jump through the audio? Index by blocks?
- How to play/pause? Can the backend do it? Or does frontend just resubmit stuff? Caching? Caching specific text blocks?
