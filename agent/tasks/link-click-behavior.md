# Task: Link Click Behavior Fixes

## Document Title Click

Current: normal click opens in new tab
Expected: ctrl+click = new tab, normal click = same tab

Also: can't right-click for standard link context menu

## Sidebar Right-Click

Should be able to right-click documents in sidebar → "Open in new tab"

Also ctrl+click should work for opening in new tab.
