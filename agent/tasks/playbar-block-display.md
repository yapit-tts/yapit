# Task: Playbar Block Display Layout

## Issue

The "block X of Y" display in the playbar takes away space from the progress bar, especially when TTS-1-Max is selected (longer model name). Looks messy, especially on mobile.

## Intent

The block number info is useful (e.g., remembering where you were), but current placement hurts the layout cleanliness. Need to figure out where/how to show this without disrupting the progress bar.

## Open Questions

- Should it be hidden on mobile entirely?
- Move to collapsible section?
- Show on hover/tap only?
- Different placement altogether?
