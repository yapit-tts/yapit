# Task: Rate Limiting

Rate limiting for to prevent spam / dozens of parallel requests from single user.
Also for document uploads (num documents in total, ... in /subscriptions we say "unlimited documents"). Pdf docs have size limit, i think, but how about websites? Could some websites break our sytem? Etc.
Is limit for uploaded vs pdf link the same? Storage limit? Storage eviction? We don't have anything about that in our terms / policy. Maybe add "within reason" or something.
