# Task: Audio Gestures (Headphone Controls)

Can we use headphone gestures to control skip forward/back in addition to play/pause (which already works)?

## Questions

- Are there standard Web Audio API events for next/previous track?
- MediaSession API — does it support more than play/pause?
- What do headphones actually send? (double-tap, triple-tap, etc.)

## Current State

Play/pause via MediaSession already works.
