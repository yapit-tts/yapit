# Task: Large Document Responsiveness

Make the app responsive even with large documents like the 1.8k pages "Rationality A to Z" (62h of audio).

Current issue: clicking on it in sidebar has noticeable delay. Otherwise seems to work well.

See [[frontend-performance-tracking]] for investigation into mount/unmount perf with large docs.
