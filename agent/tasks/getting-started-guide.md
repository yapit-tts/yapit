# Task: Getting Started / Tutorial Guide

Add a way to discover features — tutorial button, getting started guide, or feature showcase.

## Purpose

Show users what's available:
- MP3 export
- Vim keybindings (if enabled)
- Voice selection
- Playback controls
- OCR for PDFs
- etc.

## Open Questions

- Where does this live? Sidebar? Help menu? Modal on first visit?
- Inline hints vs dedicated guide page?
- Video walkthrough vs text + screenshots?
