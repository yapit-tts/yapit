# Task: Mobile Playback Page Layout

## Issues

1. **Horizontal scroll on mobile** — page can be horizontally scrolled, shouldn't be

2. **Title cutoff on LEFT side** — title + 3 action buttons at top are too big for mobile viewport

3. **Suggestion:** put 3 buttons below title on mobile instead of beside it
