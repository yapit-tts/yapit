# Task: OCR Toggle Auth/Plan Check

OCR toggle appears usable on free plan — should be disabled.

Check that:
- Frontend disables/hides OCR toggle for free users
- Backend rejects OCR requests from free users (defense in depth)
- Proper error message if somehow triggered without plan
- Update: This might have been confusion with the now removed "admin" dev bypass?
