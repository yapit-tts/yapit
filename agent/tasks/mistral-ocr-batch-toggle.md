# Task: Mistral OCR Batch Mode Toggle

Mistral OCR is 50% off with batch requests (usually not much slower, can send single requests as batch of 1).

## Decided UX

Settings toggle: "Double the rate limits for OCR, but it might take longer (several minutes) for a document to be OCR'd"

## Considerations

- Might still lead to delay
- User gets choice via toggle
