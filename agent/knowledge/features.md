# Features

User-facing capabilities. Links to task files (for simpler features) or dedicated knowledge files (for complex ones).

## Implemented

- [[2026-01-12-document-sharing]] — Share documents by link; viewers get clones to their library, preserving OCR work while using their own TTS quota
- [[2026-01-13-playwright-js-rendering]] — Automatic JS rendering for dynamic web pages (React, Vue, marked.js sites)
- [[2026-01-14-doclayout-yolo-figure-detection]] — Semantic figure detection in PDFs; handles vector graphics, groups multi-part figures, filters decorative elements
- [[markdown-parser-spec]] — TTS annotations (`yap-show`, `yap-speak`, `yap-cap`), footnotes, callouts
- [[2026-01-12-document-outliner]] — Right sidebar for navigating large documents; collapsible sections, filtered playback
- [[rate-limiting]] — TTS rate limiting (300/min), concurrent extraction limits, storage-based document limits per tier
