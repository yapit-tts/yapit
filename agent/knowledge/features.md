# Features

User-facing capabilities. Links to task files (for simpler features) or dedicated knowledge files (for complex ones).

## Implemented

- [[2026-01-12-document-sharing]] — Share documents by link; viewers get clones to their library, preserving OCR work while using their own TTS quota
- [[2026-01-13-playwright-js-rendering]] — Automatic JS rendering for dynamic web pages (React, Vue, marked.js sites)
