# Features

User-facing capabilities. Links to task files (for simpler features) or dedicated knowledge files (for complex ones).

## Implemented

- [[2026-01-12-document-sharing]] — Share documents by link; viewers get clones to their library, preserving OCR work while using their own TTS quota
- [[2026-01-13-playwright-js-rendering]] — Automatic JS rendering for dynamic web pages (React, Vue, marked.js sites)
- [[2026-01-14-doclayout-yolo-figure-detection]] — Semantic figure detection in PDFs; handles vector graphics, groups multi-part figures, filters decorative elements
- [[2026-01-15-tts-annotation-syntax-pivot]] — TTS annotations for math and captions (`<yap-alt>`, `<yap-cap>` tags)
