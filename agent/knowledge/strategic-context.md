# Strategic Context

Project priorities and business considerations that inform implementation decisions.

**Open source vs revenue**: Open source is more valuable than potential revenue. Portfolio value matters, code secrecy doesn't. If someone builds something better, that's a win. Don't optimize for preventing clones.

**What matters most**: Working product the user enjoys using, smooth UX, sustainable infra costs. Revenue is nice-to-have, not primary goal.

**Self-host / admin panel**: Still wanted, just lower priority than core playback experience. Don't deprioritize entirely.

**Economic model (uncertain as of Dec 2025)**: Live synthesis vs batch processing, free tier strategy, cold start costs on serverless - all need real performance data before deciding. Measure first (after Hetzner deployment), then make pricing/tier decisions.

**Domain situation (Dec 2025)**: yapit.app owned by another company (social media marketing). Email sent Dec 19, no response (holidays). Private beta can use any domain. Decide on rebrand before public launch if needed.

**License**: Want open source but discourage direct commercial cloning. Options to research: AGPL, BSL, Apache with commons clause. Not decided yet.
